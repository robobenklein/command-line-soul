This is an experiment for AI.

Right now, it attempts to create random correctly syntaxed statements using a word list.

I'm looking for people experienced anywhere from Python to Sentiment/Language analysis to help out.

The goal of the project is to have an open-source 'entity' that will learn how to be human-like by interacting with real humans.

The first steps are likely going to be generating a large list of plausible responses from nearly random generated sentences. Once enough are created, we can turn the tables and let the human ask the program for a response.
